# Quickstart Agents

This folder shows how to use Llama 3 and popular open source frameworks (LangChain, LlamaIndex, AutoGen) to quickly build Llama powered agent apps.

The following notebooks are ported from the agents short courses on [Deeplearning.ai](https://www.deeplearning.ai), all powered by Llama 3.
